						<h2 class="text-center">What's it all about?</h2>
						<p class="text-justify">Are you sure you want to be an engineer? Landing an internship can help you answer this question by letting you test the waters before a full commitment. If you are sitting on the fence, one of your objectives should be to learn about typical job duties to see if engineering as a career is a good fit for you. An intern position at a company with a structured internship program provides a great opportunity to learn what engineers really do. In the end, you can confirm your career path or make adjustments.

						<div class="col-sm-8">
							<h3>Connecting the Dots</h3>
							<p>An engineering internship is also an opportunity to see how classroom and textbook learning applies to the real world. In other words, internships can help you connect the dots between theory and practical work experience. For example, because engineering disciplines rely heavily on math and science, an internship can help you understand how these subjects apply to the job, such as when you land an assignment where you must calculate production rates or interpret analytical laboratory data. You will be able to observe how full-time engineers apply knowledge to handle real work situations.</p>

							<h3>Experience at Entry stage</h3>
							<p>Engineering internships can also get you relevant work experience, helping you become workforce ready before entering the job market as a graduate. Many employers give higher consideration to entry-level engineers who have experience. Additionally, intern work prepares you for the demands of a full-time job. The goal is to develop a good work history with positive references before you graduate.</p>

							<h3>High Stakes </h3>
							<p>The entrepreneur leading a newly formed startup has all of their eggs in a single basket. Their professional survival is inextricably linked to the future of the business, and as a result, they will nurture and push their idea no matter what the hurdles may be. There is no Plan B. The entrepreneur has stakeholders in the form of angel investors and venture capitalists, and they are inherently comfortable with a high degree of risk. Contrast the entrepreneur with the large, established corporation.</p>

							<h3>Controlled Chaos</h3>
							<p>The startup process and organization may seem haphazard, but it is this chaos, agility, and speed that makes the startup easily pivot to latch on to new opportunities.</p>

							<h3>Why to incubate?</h3>
							<p>Many times, you have an excellent business idea. You may even start working on it and create a prototype, but you run into some problem and then you just give up on it all together. Or at times, it’s possible that you lose interest. Then probably few years down the line, you may come across a successful business that was just what you had thought about. How you wish then that had you pursued your idea a little longer, it could have been you. Well, that’s just what an incubation centre or an accelerator will help you do – focus and hone your idea into a successful startup. If they see that your idea has potential, then they will offer you work space, initial funds and technical support. They will connect you with a mentor and also help you raise funds by connecting you with VCs, angel investors, private investors etc. Once you find space in their program, then you can focus on fine-tuning and developing your idea, as you discuss and get insights from other teams as well as mentors. And if you stumble along the way, then rest assured that you will have a lot of helping hands. They will also offer you help with things like business model, marketing, IP issues etc. However, in return for all the support and mentoring that they offer, they will claim an equity stake in your business. </p>

							<h3>You need more than an Idea</h3>
							<p>For incubators or accelerators to select you, your idea has to be powerful. It needs to have the potential to be a game-changer and truly innovative. It will be evaluated by domain experts and if they see a potential, only then you will find place in the program. The seats are limited and the competition fierce, so your pitch has to be strong and should convince them of its value. Apart from a business idea, what will also determine your success is your core team. In fact, when you approach incubators or accelerators, one important point of consideration for them is whether your passion is shared by your core team. </p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-sm-6">
							<h3>Incubation equals success?</h3>
							<p>Getting a place in the incubation program is definitely a big deal, as it proves that your idea has the potential. Because before you are incubated, your idea is thoroughly evaluated by a group of experts for its validity and its chances of success. But that doesn’t necessarily guarantee success and the biggest reason could be you</p>

This is more likely to happen if you are either from 1st or 3rd semester students for a very brief period.

As its required for you to learn certain things,It gives a sense of how to start with it.
